        <h2>An accessible website</h2>

        <p>I believe that all websites should be fully accessible to everyone, and this website is created in the honour
            of accessibility across the web.</p>

                <h2>Universal access</h2>
                <p>Universal access refers to all people having equal opportunity and access to a service or product
                    from which they can benefit, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, background or physical
                    disabilities. It is a vision, and is some cases a legal term, that spans many fields, including
                    education, disability, telecommunications, and healthcare. It is tied strongly to the concept of
                    human rights.</p>

                <h2>AI accessibility</h2>
                <p>Artifical intelligence plays a huge part in accessibility. AI is used in language caption,
                    translations, voice assistance (e.g. screen reader), image recognition, facial recognition,
                    summarizing information, lip reading, user navigation (AI navigation systems can aid with real time
                    guidance for people with mobility issues) and regression testing (AI can assist in automating and
                    testing systems for developers to ensure it is accessible).</p>

                <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                <p>This website tries to be sustainable with it's design.</p>
                <h3>How??</h3>
                <p>Using SVG images that take up less space than PNG and JPG. And by keeping a simple design and a dark
                    background (that needs less energy to display).</p>
